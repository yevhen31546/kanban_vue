The app allows you to manage projects and tasks visually using board. One board represents one project. A board contains one or more lists. Each list represents the category of tasks, such as Todo, Doing and Done. You can drag-n-drop to change the order of lists, the order of tasks inside the list, and also move task from one list to another as well- to manage the project as it moves through different stages.
